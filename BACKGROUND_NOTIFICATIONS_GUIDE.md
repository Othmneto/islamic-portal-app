# Background Notifications Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Notifications Not Working When Browser/Page is Closed

### Understanding Background Notifications

**Background notifications** (when the browser is closed) rely on the browser's **background push service** and the **service worker**. This is different from foreground notifications (when the page is open).

### Chrome/Chromium Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Comet)

#### Requirements for Background Notifications:
1. ‚úÖ **Service Worker registered** - Already done
2. ‚úÖ **Push subscription active** - Already done
3. ‚úÖ **`userVisibleOnly: true`** in subscription - Already set
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Browser process must be running in background** - This is the key issue!

#### Why Chrome Doesn't Receive Background Notifications:

Chrome on Windows has **background process management** that determines whether the browser stays running when all windows are closed:

**Option 1: Chrome Background Apps Setting (RECOMMENDED)**
1. Open Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://settings/` or click menu (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí Settings
3. Search for "background"
4. Find **"Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed"**
5. **Enable this setting** ‚úÖ
6. Restart Chrome
7. **Now when you close all Chrome windows, Chrome will stay running in the system tray**

**To verify Chrome is running in background:**
- After closing all Chrome windows, check Windows System Tray (bottom-right corner)
- You should see a Chrome icon
- Right-click it to see "Keep Chrome running in background" option

**Option 2: Use Task Manager**
After closing all Chrome windows:
1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Look for "Google Chrome" or "Chrome" processes
3. If you see Chrome processes still running ‚Üí Background notifications will work ‚úÖ
4. If NO Chrome processes ‚Üí Background notifications will NOT work ‚ùå

#### Comet Browser Specific:
Comet is Chromium-based, so it follows the same rules:
- Check Comet settings for "background apps" option
- Or verify Comet processes remain in Task Manager after closing windows

### Firefox

#### Requirements for Background Notifications:
1. ‚úÖ **Service Worker registered** - Already done
2. ‚úÖ **Push subscription active** - Already done
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Firefox must be running (even minimized)** - This is crucial!

#### Firefox Background Notification Behavior:

**Important: Firefox on desktop does NOT support true background notifications when the browser is fully closed.**

However, Firefox WILL receive notifications when:
- ‚úÖ Firefox is open (any tab, any window)
- ‚úÖ Firefox is minimized to taskbar
- ‚ùå Firefox is completely closed (all windows closed, no Firefox in Task Manager)

**Workaround for Firefox:**
- Keep Firefox running minimized in the background
- Or use Firefox to set up auto-start on system boot (Windows Startup Apps)

### Testing Procedure

#### 1. Test Immediate Notifications (Page Open)
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/prayer-time.html
2. Enable notifications
3. Click "Test Server Notification" button
4. ‚úÖ Should receive notification immediately
5. Check browser console for logs

#### 2. Test Scheduled Reminders (Page Open)
1. On prayer-time.html, click "Test Scheduled Reminder (2 min)" button
2. Wait 2 minutes (keep page open)
3. ‚úÖ Should receive notification after 2 minutes
4. Check server logs to see which browser types received the notification

#### 3. Test Background Notifications (Page Closed)

**For Chrome/Chromium:**
1. Ensure "Continue running background apps" is enabled in Chrome settings
2. Go to prayer-time.html and enable notifications
3. Click "Test Scheduled Reminder (2 min)" button
4. **Close the browser window (all windows)**
5. **Verify Chrome process is still running** (Task Manager or System Tray icon)
6. Wait 2 minutes
7. ‚úÖ Should receive notification even though browser is closed

**For Firefox:**
1. Go to prayer-time.html and enable notifications
2. Click "Test Scheduled Reminder (2 min)" button
3. **Minimize Firefox** (don't close it!)
4. Wait 2 minutes
5. ‚úÖ Should receive notification
6. **If you close Firefox completely** ‚Üí ‚ùå Will NOT receive notification

#### 4. Test Multi-Browser Setup
1. **Open Chrome** ‚Üí Go to prayer-time.html ‚Üí Enable notifications
2. **Open Firefox** ‚Üí Go to prayer-time.html ‚Üí Enable notifications
3. Check server logs: Should show 2 subscriptions for your user (1 FCM, 1 Mozilla)
4. On either browser, click "Test Scheduled Reminder (2 min)"
5. **Both browsers should receive the notification** (even if pages are closed but processes are running)

### Server-Side Verification

Check the server logs for these messages:

```
[subscribe] User 67abc123... now has 2 subscription(s):
  1. FCM(Chrome) - Active: true - Browser: Chrome
  2. Mozilla(Firefox) - Active: true - Browser: Firefox
```

When a notification is sent:
```
[test-scheduled-reminder] Found 2 subscription(s) for user 67abc123...
  - FCM(Chrome): Active=true
  - Mozilla(Firefox): Active=true

‚úÖ [test-scheduled-reminder] CHROME notification sent successfully
‚úÖ [test-scheduled-reminder] FIREFOX notification sent successfully
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "No notifications when browser is closed"
**Solution:** 
- **Chrome:** Enable "Continue running background apps" in settings
- **Firefox:** Keep browser minimized, not closed

#### Issue: "Only Chrome receives notifications, Firefox doesn't"
**Solution:**
- Check Firefox console for errors
- Verify Firefox subscription is in database (check server logs)
- Ensure Firefox is running (minimized or open)
- Try the diagnostic tool: Click "üîç Run Full Diagnostics" button

#### Issue: "Notifications work when page is open, but not when closed"
**Solution:**
- This is expected for Firefox (needs to be running)
- For Chrome: Enable background apps setting
- Verify browser process is running in Task Manager

#### Issue: "Database shows 2 subscriptions but only 1 receives notifications"
**Solution:**
- Check server logs to see which browser's push failed
- Run "Test Scheduled Reminder" and check server logs for browser-specific errors
- Firefox subscription might be marked as inactive incorrectly

### Pre-Prayer Reminder Setup

Once background notifications are working:

1. Go to prayer-time.html ‚Üí Settings
2. Set "Pre-Prayer Reminder" to 10 minutes
3. Enable "Enable Notifications" toggle
4. Enable specific prayers (Fajr, Dhuhr, etc.)
5. **Keep Chrome running in background** (or Firefox minimized)
6. You'll receive notifications 10 minutes before each prayer time

### Technical Details

**What we implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Multi-device subscription storage (unique per browser/device)
- ‚úÖ Send notifications to ALL active subscriptions in parallel
- ‚úÖ Browser-specific error logging (FCM vs Mozilla Push)
- ‚úÖ Test scheduled reminder endpoint for debugging
- ‚úÖ Service worker with browser-specific notification options

**What the browser does:**
- Chrome: Can run in background with background apps enabled
- Firefox: Must be running (open or minimized)
- Service worker receives push events and displays notifications
- Even if all tabs are closed, service worker can receive pushes (if browser process is running)

### Windows Notification Settings

Also verify Windows itself allows notifications:

1. **Windows + I** ‚Üí System ‚Üí Notifications & actions
2. Ensure "Get notifications from apps and other senders" is **ON**
3. Find your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Comet) in the list
4. Click on it and ensure notifications are **Allowed**
5. Check **Focus Assist** (Windows + A) - ensure it's **OFF** or set to "Priority only"

### Summary

**For Chrome/Chromium (including Comet):**
- ‚úÖ Enable "Continue running background apps" in settings
- ‚úÖ Verify Chrome stays running in Task Manager after closing windows
- ‚úÖ Background notifications will work when browser is in background

**For Firefox:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep Firefox running (minimized is fine, fully closed is not)
- ‚úÖ Notifications work when Firefox is open/minimized
- ‚ùå Notifications do NOT work when Firefox is fully closed

**For Multi-Device:**
- ‚úÖ Already implemented - each browser/device gets its own subscription
- ‚úÖ All devices receive notifications simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Check server logs to verify all subscriptions are active

**Next Steps:**
1. Enable Chrome background apps
2. Test with "Test Scheduled Reminder (2 min)" button
3. Close Chrome windows (verify it stays in Task Manager)
4. Wait 2 minutes ‚Üí Should receive notification ‚úÖ
5. If working, set up pre-prayer reminders (10 minutes before)
