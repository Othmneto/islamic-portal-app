Based on server logs at 12:12 PM:
- **Asr**: Scheduled for 3:16 PM
- **Asr Reminder**: Scheduled for 3:14 PM (2 minutes before)
- **Server Time**: 12:12 PM

## What to Expect

### At 3:14 PM - Asr Reminder
You should see:
1. Notification: "‚è∞ 2 min until Asr Prayer"
2. Body: "Prepare for Asr prayer"

### At 3:16 PM - Asr Main Notification
You should see:
1. Notification: "Asr Prayer"
2. Body: "It's time for Asr prayer..." + motivational message
3. Server logs: `üîî [PrayerScheduler] asr time! Cron fired at...`
4. **Adhan should play** (if audio is enabled in settings)

## If Notifications Don't Arrive

### Check 1: Browser Console
1. Open prayer-time.html in Chrome
2. Press F12 ‚Üí Console
3. Look for service worker messages at 3:14 PM and 3:16 PM

### Check 2: Service Worker Status
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application ‚Üí Service Workers
3. Verify service worker is active
4. Check "Console" tab for SW logs

### Check 3: Notification Permissions
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy and security ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Notifications
2. Verify your localhost site has "Allow" permission

### Check 4: Server Logs
Look for these entries at 3:14 PM and 3:16 PM:
```
üîî [PrayerScheduler] asr reminder time! Sending reminder notifications...
üì¨ [PrayerScheduler] Reloaded 2 fresh subscription(s) from DB for reminder
[PrayerScheduler] Reminder subscriptions breakdown:

‚úÖ [PrayerScheduler] asr sent to ahmedothmanofff@gmail.com (Xms)
```

## Expected Behavior

1. At 3:14 PM: You receive reminder notification
2. At 3:16 PM: You receive main Asr notification
3. After notification: Audio should play (if enabled)
4. Browser logs: Should show SW received notification and attempted to play audio

## Common Issues

### Notification appears but no adhan
- Check audio is enabled in settings
- Check browser console for audio errors
- Check service worker logs

### No notification at all
- Check browser notification permissions
- Check server logs for cron execution
- Verify subscriptions are active
- Check if prayer is enabled in preferences

### Only one browser receives notification
- Check both Chrome and Firefox subscriptions are active
- Check server logs for "Reloaded X fresh subscription(s)"
- Should show 2 subscriptions (Chrome + Firefox)

## Next Steps

After Asr test:
- Maghrib at 5:42 PM (reminder 5:40 PM)
- Isha at 7:12 PM (reminder 7:10 PM)
