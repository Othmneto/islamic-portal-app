# Dynamic Prayer Notification Scheduling - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented dynamic prayer notification scheduling that eliminates the need for server restarts when users change their notification preferences.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Central Event Emitter ✅
**File:** `services/eventEmitter.js`
- Created a shared EventEmitter instance for communication between API routes and scheduler
- Simple, lightweight implementation using Node.js built-in EventEmitter

### 2. Event Emission in User Routes ✅
**File:** `routes/userRoutes.js`
- **Route 1:** `PUT /api/user/preferences` - Now emits `userPreferencesChanged` event after successful updates
- **Route 2:** `PUT /api/user/notification-preferences` - Now emits `userPreferencesChanged` event after successful updates
- Events are emitted with the user ID as the payload

### 3. Dynamic Scheduler Refactor ✅
**File:** `tasks/prayerNotificationScheduler.js`
- **Added `cancelUserJobs(userId)`** - Stops all existing cron jobs for a specific user
- **Added `rescheduleNotificationsForUser(userId)`** - Reloads user preferences from DB and reschedules all notifications
- **Added event listener** - Listens for `userPreferencesChanged` events and triggers rescheduling
- **Enhanced job tracking** - Uses existing registry Map to track and manage user jobs
- **Preserved existing functionality** - All original scheduling logic remains intact

## How It Works

### Before (Static Scheduling)
1. User changes `reminderMinutes` from 5 to 10
2. Frontend saves to `/api/user/preferences`
3. Database is updated
4. **❌ Scheduler continues using old value (5 minutes) until server restart**

### After (Dynamic Scheduling)
1. User changes `reminderMinutes` from 5 to 10
2. Frontend saves to `/api/user/preferences`
3. Database is updated
4. **✅ `userPreferencesChanged` event is emitted**
5. **✅ Scheduler receives event and cancels old jobs**
6. **✅ Scheduler reloads user preferences from DB**
7. **✅ Scheduler creates new jobs with updated settings**
8. **✅ New schedule is active immediately**

## Key Benefits

1. **No Server Restarts Required** - Users can change settings and see immediate effects
2. **Real-time Updates** - Notification schedules update instantly when preferences change
3. **Robust Error Handling** - Graceful handling of errors during rescheduling
4. **Backward Compatible** - Existing functionality remains unchanged
5. **Event-driven Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns between API and scheduler

## Technical Details

### Event Flow
```
User Changes Settings → API Route → Database Update → Event Emission → Scheduler → Job Cancellation → Fresh DB Read → New Job Creation
```

### Job Management
- **Job Tracking:** Uses existing `registry` Map to track user jobs
- **Job Cancellation:** Stops all prayer jobs and daily refresh jobs for the user
- **Job Recreation:** Creates new jobs with fresh preferences from database
- **Error Recovery:** Continues operation even if individual job cancellation fails

### Database Integration
- **Fresh Data:** Always reads latest user preferences from database during rescheduling
- **Selective Loading:** Only loads necessary fields (`email`, `location`, `timezone`, `notificationPreferences`, `preferences`)
- **Lean Queries:** Uses `.lean()` for optimal performance

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the server
2. Change `reminderMinutes` from 5 to 10 in the frontend
3. Check server logs for rescheduling messages:
   ```
   [PrayerScheduler] Received userPreferencesChanged event for user 6888c9391815657294913e8d
   [PrayerScheduler] Rescheduling notifications for user 6888c9391815657294913e8d
   [PrayerScheduler] Cancelled X jobs for user 6888c9391815657294913e8d
   [PrayerScheduler] Successfully rescheduled notifications for user 6888c9391815657294913e8d
   ```
4. Verify new notification times are calculated correctly
5. No server restart should be required

### Expected Log Output
```
[PrayerScheduler] Received userPreferencesChanged event for user 6888c9391815657294913e8d
[PrayerScheduler] Rescheduling notifications for user 6888c9391815657294913e8d
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled job: fajr
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled job: dhuhr
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled job: asr
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled job: maghrib
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled job: isha
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled job: fajr_reminder
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled job: dhuhr_reminder
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled job: asr_reminder
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled job: maghrib_reminder
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled job: isha_reminder
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled daily job
[PrayerScheduler] Cancelled 11 jobs for user 6888c9391815657294913e8d
[PrayerScheduler] Scheduling for ahmedothmanofff@gmail.com in Asia/Dubai:
[PrayerScheduler] Reminder minutes: 10
[PrayerScheduler] Successfully rescheduled notifications for user 6888c9391815657294913e8d
```

## Files Modified

1. **`services/eventEmitter.js`** - New file with shared EventEmitter
2. **`routes/userRoutes.js`** - Added event emission to 2 routes
3. **`tasks/prayerNotificationScheduler.js`** - Added dynamic scheduling functions and event listener

## Future Enhancements

The dynamic scheduling system is now in place and can be easily extended for:
- Real-time notification status dashboard
- Bulk preference updates
- A/B testing of notification timings
- Advanced scheduling analytics

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The dynamic prayer notification scheduling system is fully implemented and ready for testing. Users can now change their notification preferences without requiring server restarts.
