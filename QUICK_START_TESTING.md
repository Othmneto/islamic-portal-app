   ‚Üí Enable notifications when prompted
   ‚Üí Check console: Should see "Notification permission granted"
```

### Step 3: Verify Multi-Device Setup
```
Check server logs (terminal):

You should see:
[subscribe] User 67abc123... now has 2 subscription(s):
  1. FCM(Chrome) - Active: true - Browser: Chrome

```

4. Close Chrome windows (Chrome will stay running in system tray)
5. Minimize Firefox (don't close it!)
6. Wait 2 minutes
7. ‚úÖ BOTH browsers should receive notification!
```

### Step 5: Check Server Logs
```
After 2 minutes, check terminal:

[NotificationService] Endpoint: https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send/...
‚úÖ [test-scheduled-reminder] CHROME notification sent successfully

[NotificationService] Sending to Mozilla(Firefox)
[NotificationService] Endpoint: https://updates.push.services.mozilla.com/...

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### "Chrome didn't receive notification"

## üéØ Next Steps After Success

Once the 2-minute test works:

### Enable Pre-Prayer Reminders
```
1. On prayer-time page, find "Settings" section
2. Set "Pre-Prayer Reminder" to "10 minutes before"
3. Enable "Enable Notifications" toggle
4. Enable the prayers you want: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha
5. Save settings
```

### Keep Browsers Running
```
Chrome: Just close windows - Chrome stays in background ‚úÖ
Firefox: Keep minimized or open ‚ö†Ô∏è

When prayer time approaches:
- 10 minutes before: Both browsers will receive reminder
- At prayer time: Both browsers will receive main notification
```
