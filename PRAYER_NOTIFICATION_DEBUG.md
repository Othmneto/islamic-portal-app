# Prayer Notification Debug Guide

## Issue Summary
- User received pre-prayer reminder
- User did NOT receive the actual prayer time notification at 12:03 PM
- No adhan was played

## What We Fixed
Added logging to cron job execution to verify timezone is working correctly.

## What We Need From User

Please provide these logs around 12:03 PM (or the time you expected the notification):

1. **Scheduling Log** (should show 5 minutes before or when you last changed settings):
   ```
   ‚è∞ [PrayerScheduler] Scheduling dhuhr at 12:03 PM (3 12 * * *) in timezone Asia/Dubai
   ```

2. **Cron Firing Log** (should show at exactly 12:03 PM):
   ```
   üîî [PrayerScheduler] dhuhr time! Cron fired at 2025-10-26T08:03:00.000Z
   üîî [PrayerScheduler] Cron running in timezone Asia/Dubai for user ahmedothmanofff@gmail.com
   ```

3. **Subscription Loading Log**:
   ```
   üì¨ [PrayerScheduler] Reloaded 2 fresh subscription(s) from DB
   ```

4. **Notification Sending Log**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ [PrayerScheduler] dhuhr sent to ahmedothmanofff@gmail.com (123ms)
   ```

## Possible Causes

### 1. Timezone Mismatch
The server might be running in UTC timezone, so 12:03 PM Asia/Dubai would fire at 8:03 AM UTC.

### 2. Prayer Toggle Disabled
Dhuhr notification might be disabled in user settings.

### 3. Subscription Issues
Subscriptions might be marked as inactive.

### 4. Cron Job Not Started
The cron job might not have been started properly.

## How to Check

### Check User Preferences
Go to http://localhost:3000/prayer-time.html and verify:
- Notifications enabled: **ON**
- Dhuhr prayer toggle: **ON**

### Check Subscription Status
Look in server logs for:
```
[PrayerScheduler] Found 2 active subscription(s) for ahmedothmanofff@gmail.com
  - Chrome: Updated 2025-10-26T...
  - Firefox: Updated 2025-10-26T...
```

### Check Scheduled Prayers
Look in server logs for:
```
üïê [PrayerScheduler] Current time: XXX minutes
üïê [PrayerScheduler] dhuhr: 12:03 PM (723 minutes from midnight)
‚è∞ [PrayerScheduler] dhuhr will be at 12:03 PM in timezone Asia/Dubai
‚è∞ [PrayerScheduler] Scheduling dhuhr at 12:03 PM (3 12 * * *) in timezone Asia/Dubai
‚úÖ [PrayerScheduler] dhuhr scheduled for 12:03 PM in Asia/Dubai
```

## Next Steps

1. **Provide server logs** from around 12:03 PM (or whenever the notification should have fired)
2. **Check user settings** - verify Dhuhr is enabled
3. **Wait for next prayer** - check if Isha works
4. **Manually trigger test** - click test notification button to verify service worker is working
