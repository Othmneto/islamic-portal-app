- Password history tracking: `passwordHistory`
- 2FA ready fields: `twoFactorEnabled`, `twoFactorSecret`, `backupCodes`
- Security methods: `isAccountLocked()`, `incrementLoginAttempts()`, `resetLoginAttempts()`

### Rate Limiting Configuration
- **Login Endpoint**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **Auth Endpoints**: 10 requests per 15 minutes
- **API Endpoints**: 300 requests per 15 minutes
- **Notification Endpoints**: 200 requests per hour
